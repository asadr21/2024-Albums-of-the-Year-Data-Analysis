If 9 out of 10 people who know me are aware that I am music obsessed, 8 out of 10 know that I am obsessive enough to prefer appreciating music in album form. I can respect a good playlist, but I just think there’s so much to gain from a good album. Listening to an album front to back can be a rich and entirely immersive experience of losing yourself in a world, like a good novel or film [1]. Navigating an artist’s personal and creative journey through their discography is another layer of storytelling, albums serving as distinct time capsules that bring to life a biographical narrative in both an explicit and implicit sense [2]. There’s also the greater appreciation for wider culture you get from listening to albums — the way in which albums influence genres, sounds and subcultures, and inspire them to evolve and meld and morph [3]. That’s the yearly album-listening pitch — some case in points below (which are each one of infinite examples).

My preference for album listening means that my Spotify wrapped is almost always dominated by song from my top couple of albums, which doesn’t reflect the breadth of music I liked each year. Clearly, the more fitting way of ‘wrapping’ my Spotify is in terms of album listens. Thankfully, I’m a data analyst with a Last FM account that has been tracking my music listening since 2017. Although Last FM profiles do offer top album stats, I wanted to change how those stats were calculated, and do some more digging. Using the Last FM API, I wrote a Python script to obtain album listens*, aggregated statistics and the visualisations shared here. But before that — the list.

*An album listening session was only counted as such if two or more consecutive listens were from the same album. The album listen was then counted as the tracks listened to as a fraction of the total tracks on the album e.g. if I listened to three tracks from a twelve track album, that’s 0.25 listens of the album.
